<h1> CYBORG SELVES  </h1>
<h2> A THEOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE POSTHUMAN</h2>
<h3>  THE CYBORG MANIFESTO</h3>
<P>Posthuman discourse has crystallized around two very different possibilities: Donna Haraway’s cyborg, and transhumanist “uploads.” These two visions mark a bifurcation of posthuman possibility and employ radically differing philosophical and ethical commitments. Mapping the contrast between these two competing posthuman visions provides both an entry into the posthuman discourse as well as illuminating the issues at stake. The image of the cyborg comes to the fore in discussion of the posthuman because it is such a potent symbol of the difference effected by technology between the human and the posthuman. In the figure of the cyborg, the human is physically intertwined with the nonhuman, the organic with the mechanical. The cyborg, therefore, has become the symbol of the posthuman par excellence, for it wears its differences visibly, literally engrafted into the skin. Feminist theorist Donna Haraway’s work on the symbol of the cyborg has proved (to use a doubly ironic term) seminal, as Haraway’s landmark essay, “A Cyborg Manifesto,” has become a reference point for discussions of the posthuman.1 Even as she herself has moved on from the figure of the cyborg and distanced herself from the term posthuman, the philosophical and ethical issues she identifies in the “Manifesto” have been taken up by other scholars, making this essay indispensable for entry into the posthuman discussion. In “A Cyborg Manifesto,” Haraway builds on a critique of feminist essentialism, in which the identity of woman qua woman is assumed to be naturally given, selfevident, and unchanging. She points out that challenging patriarchal and colonial essentializing tendencies eventually leads to the conclusion that all claims of identity based on a natural or organic standpoint are suspect. This is her reason for choosing the cyborg as a feminist symbol; identifying herself as “cyborg” is Haraway’s symbolic shorthand for the rejection of any attempt to define human identity on the basis of “nature.” This basic stance is the key critique of Haraway’s posthuman discourse on human nature, a deliberate breakdown of the dichotomy between nature and technology.
