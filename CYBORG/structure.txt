essay
Posthuman discourse has crystallized around two very different possibilities: Donna Haraway’s cyborg, and transhumanist “uploads.” These two visions mark a bifurcation of posthuman possibility and employ radically differing philosophical and ethical commitments. Mapping the contrast between 
these two competing posthuman visions provides both an entry into the posthuman discourse as well as illuminating the issues at stake. The image of the cyborg comes to the fore in discussion of the posthuman because it is such a potent symbol of the difference effected by technology between the 
human and the posthuman. In the figure of the cyborg, the human is physically intertwined with the nonhuman, the organic with the mechanical. The cyborg, therefore, has become the symbol of the posthuman par excellence, for it wears its differences visibly, literally engrafted into the skin. 
Feminist theorist Donna Haraway’s work on the symbol of the cyborg has proved (to use a doubly ironic term) seminal, as Haraway’s landmark essay, “A Cyborg Manifesto,” has become a reference point for discussions of the posthuman.1 Even as she herself has moved on from the figure of the cyborg 
and distanced herself from the term posthuman, the philosophical and ethical issues she identifies in the “Manifesto” have been taken up by other scholars, making this essay indispensable for entry into the posthuman discussion. In “A Cyborg Manifesto,” Haraway builds on a critique of feminist
essentialism, in which the identity of woman qua woman is assumed to be naturally given, selfevident, and unchanging. She points out that challenging patriarchal and colonial essentializing tendencies eventually leads to the conclusion that all claims of identity based on a natural or organic 
standpoint are suspect. This is her reason for choosing the cyborg as a feminist symbol; identifying herself as “cyborg” is Haraway’s symbolic shorthand for the rejection of any attempt to define human identity on the basis of “nature.” This basic stance is the key critique of Haraway’s posthuman
discourse on human nature, a deliberate breakdown of the dichotomy between nature and technology

As a child, I was fascinated with world maps, which were always Mercator. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I realised Greenland was not twice as large as Australia, as the Mercator projection asserts, but that Australia in reality was three times larger than Greenland. 

Google Earth is more than the God’s-eye view – more than just us mortals seeing through the eyes of God. In Google Earth, we are God. We see over, under, inside and out. We see into the beyond, with a second sight unavailable to our mortal selves. We see ghosts of dead friends and dead strangers. We see ourselves. If the colonial God’s-eye view in Mercator maps is an uneasy settling of the planet (hoping the savages will stay in their place and not upset the prescribed order), then Google Earth, with its forking paths Google Maps and Google Street View, is a parallel world bleeding into this one.

“Copyright traps” are fake features cartographers insert into maps to catch plagiarists. If the map is copied and published without permission, it can be traced due to the inclusion of a street leading in the wrong direction, or a building that doesn’t exist. In Street View, such impossible objects are a matter of course. 

Google boundaries are porous. They dissolve. I have never seen anything so beautiful in all my life as the melting freeways of the USA, the next nature of glitched-out Google projections. In Google Earth, images are spliced together, taken at different times of day. Sometimes you can see the joins, where the process hasn’t fully knitted. It might be an RGB-separated cloud of light surrounding an object, or a pink-yellow pixel-glitch tornado rising to the sky. Sometimes in Street View, if your connection is slow, when moving through a city, the interlacing mechanism is revealed. You can see the front of a building sliding in over the background, compressing the architecture into a narrow band of light so that it appears to be a paper-thin facade slipping into place. Reality becomes a stage set, the scenery changing before your eyes.
